# HL7 Forge — Roadmap

This document tracks all milestones and planned features. Each milestone lists its tasks, completion status, and acceptance criteria.

---

## Milestone 0 — MVP

**Goal:** Core MLLP server with real-time web UI for receiving and inspecting HL7 v2.x messages.

**Status: Complete**

### Tasks

- [x] MLLP server with Tokio (async TCP, correct `0x0B`/`0x1C 0x0D` framing)
- [x] ACK/NAK responses (AA, AE)
- [x] HL7 v2.x parser (dynamic delimiter detection, MSH/PID extraction)
- [x] In-memory message store with broadcast channel
- [x] Web UI with real-time message list (WebSocket)
- [x] Segment/field detail view (Parsed, Raw, JSON tabs)
- [x] Search filter (message type, patient, facility, ID)
- [x] JSON export
- [x] Route fix for message detail view (`:id` instead of `{id}`)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Messages are received via MLLP and displayed in real-time in the browser
- [x] ACK/NACK responses are sent correctly
- [x] Messages can be searched and exported as JSON

## Milestone 1 — Team-Ready Server

**Goal:** HL7 Forge runs stably as a Windows service on the dev server, is configurable without recompilation, and holds up under high load.

**Status: Complete**

### Requirements

- Milestone 0 (MVP) fully complete

### Tasks

- [x] **Configuration file** (`hl7-forge.toml`) — ports, memory limits, log level, retention configurable
- [x] **File Logging** — standard rotating log files for operation monitoring
- [x] **Portable binary** — single `.exe` without dependencies, xcopy deployment
- [x] **Backpressure handling** — evict oldest messages when the store is full instead of OOM
- [x] **Memory Management** — configurable memory budget (e.g. max 512 MB RAM) with automatic eviction
- [x] **Connection limits** — cap maximum concurrent MLLP connections
- [x] **Graceful shutdown** — cleanly terminate active connections on service stop

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Server starts via `hl7-forge.toml` with configured ports and limits
- [x] When the memory budget is reached, old messages are evicted — no OOM
- [x] `Ctrl+C` or service stop terminates active MLLP connections cleanly

> **Note:** Windows Service installation is handled externally via NSSM (`nssm install HL7Forge hl7-forge.exe`). No native `windows-service` crate integration needed.

## Milestone 2 — Multi-User Experience

**Goal:** Multiple developers work productively against the same server simultaneously without interfering with each other.

**Status: Complete**

### Requirements

- Milestone 1 complete (stable server with configuration)

### Tasks

- [x] **Session-based views** — each developer sees their own filter configuration, scroll position and selection
- [x] **Color-coded source markers** — messages visually distinguishable by sender system/IP
- [x] **Message tagging** — manual tagging (e.g. "Bug #1234", "Test scenario A") for attribution
- [x] **Bookmark/Pin** — mark important messages so they don't get lost in the stream; eviction-protected

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Two browser tabs show independent filters and selections
- [x] Messages from different source IPs are visually distinguishable
- [x] Tags persist across page reloads (session scope)
- [x] Bookmarked messages are protected from eviction and persist across page reloads

---

## Milestone 3 — Message Analysis

**Goal:** Developers understand HL7 messages directly in the UI — field names, validation, diff.

**Status: Complete**

### Requirements

- Milestone 1 complete (stable server)

### Tasks

- [x] **HL7 field dictionary** — hover tooltips with field descriptions (e.g. "PID-5: Patient Name") based on embedded HL7 v2.5.1 spec (#48)
- [x] **Segment description tooltips** — hover segment headers and typical-segment badges for their HL7 description (#45)
- [x] **Message type detection** — ADT, ORM, ORU, SIU, MDM etc. with human-readable description and a "Typical segments" bar showing present/absent segments (#45, #50)
- [x] **Validation** — rule-based engine checks required MSH fields and message-type-specific segments; warnings shown as amber badges in the list and a warning panel in the detail view (#46, #51)
- [x] **Segment diff** — pin any message as a reference with the `◎` button; open the Diff tab on any other message for a field-level side-by-side comparison with red/green highlighting (#47, #52)
- [ ] **Dictionary Version Support** — verify HL7 versions to officially support and define a distribution/toggle strategy (deferred to post-M3)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Hovering over an HL7 field shows its name and description from the spec
- [x] Validation warnings appear for missing required fields
- [x] Diff view shows field differences between two messages highlighted in colour

## Milestone 4 — Workflow & Testing

**Goal:** Rapid testing against Orchestra — send, edit, replay messages directly from the UI.

**Status: Planned**

### Requirements

- Milestone 1 complete (stable server)

### Tasks

- [ ] **Message replay** — resend stored messages to a configurable target address/port (MLLP client)
- [ ] **Test message generator** — templates for common types (ADT^A01, ORM^O01, ORU^R01) with editable fields
- [ ] **Message editor** — edit raw HL7 in the UI and send
- [ ] **Auto-refresh trigger** — desktop notification on new messages (optional)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A received message can be replayed to a configured target address with a single click
- [ ] A template can be filled out in the UI, sent, and the response (ACK/NAK) displayed
- [ ] Raw HL7 can be edited and sent directly

---

## Milestone 5 — Persistence

**Goal:** Messages survive server restarts. Automatic cleanup after configurable retention.

**Status: Planned**

### Requirements

- Milestone 1 complete (configuration file in place)

### Tasks

- [ ] **SQLite backend** — optional persistence, enabled via `hl7-forge.toml`
- [ ] **Retention policy** — automatic deletion after X days or X messages
- [ ] **Extended export** — CSV export, HL7 file export (`.hl7`), filtered exports

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] After a server restart, persisted messages are visible again
- [ ] Retention deletes messages automatically after configured age/count
- [ ] Export as CSV and `.hl7` works for filtered results

---

## Milestone 6 — FHIR & Monitoring

**Goal:** Future-proofing through FHIR preview and observability through a monitoring dashboard.

**Status: Planned**

### Requirements

- Milestone 3 complete (message analysis as basis for FHIR mapping)

### Tasks

**FHIR R4 Preview**
- [ ] **HL7 v2 → FHIR R4 mapping** — display ADT messages as FHIR bundles (Patient, Encounter)
- [ ] **FHIR JSON view** — additional tab in the detail view
- [ ] **FHIR HTTP endpoint** — REST endpoint for FHIR bundles/resources

**Monitoring & Statistics**
- [ ] **Dashboard view** — messages per minute/hour, type distribution, error rate as charts
- [ ] **Latency tracking** — time difference between MSH-7 and receive time
- [ ] **Alerting** — configurable warnings at error rate > X% or outage > Y minutes
- [ ] **Health endpoint** — `/api/health` for monitoring tools (Zabbix, PRTG)

**Extended Features**
- [ ] **Multi-port listener** — multiple MLLP ports simultaneously (test separate Orchestra channels)
- [ ] **TLS support** — encrypted MLLP connections (MLLP/S)
- [ ] **ACK configuration** — customizable ACK responses (e.g. always send NAK to test retry logic)
- [ ] **Regex filter** — extended search with regular expressions
- [ ] **Dark/Light theme toggle**

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ADT messages can be displayed as a FHIR bundle (JSON)
- [ ] Dashboard shows message volume and error rate as a chart
- [ ] `/api/health` returns server status for external monitoring tools
- [ ] Multi-port listener receives on configured ports in parallel

## Nice-to-Have (No Priority)

- [ ] **Plugin system** — load custom parsers/transformers as WASM modules
- [ ] **REST API for CI/CD** — send messages programmatically and verify results (automated integration tests)
- [ ] **Audit log** — who viewed/sent which message and when
- [ ] **Import from HL7 Inspector** — migrate existing message collections
- [ ] **Orchestra log correlation** — link message IDs to Orchestra channel logs
